        "category": "chinese",
        "ingredients": {
            "fresh chicken": "1kg whole chicken",
            "kosher salt": "60g kosher salt",
            "fresh ginger": "6mm thinly sliced ginger",
            "sesame oil": "2 tablespoons sesame oil",
            "garlic": "2 cloves garlic",
            "rice": "250g fragrance rice"
        },
        "steps": "1. To clean the chicken, rub all over with a handful of kosher salt, getting rid of any loose skin. Rinse the chicken well inside and out. Pat dry with paper towels.\n2. Remove any excess fat from the chicken and set aside for later.\n3. Season the chicken generously with salt. Stuff the chicken cavity with the ginger slices and scallions.\n4. Place the chicken in a large stock pot, cover with cold water by 1 inch (2 cm), and season with salt to taste.\n5. Bring to a boil over high heat, then immediately reduce the heat to low to maintain a simmer. Cover and cook for about 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F (75°C). Remove the pot from the heat.\n6. Remove the chicken from the pot, reserving the poaching liquid for later, and transfer to an ice bath for 5 minutes to stop the cooking process and to keep the chicken skin springy. Discard the ginger and green onion.\n7. After it’s cooled, pat the chicken dry with paper towels and rub all over with sesame oil. This will help prevent the chicken from drying out.\n8. In a large wok or skillet, heat ¼ cup (60 ml) of sesame oil over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of reserved chopped chicken fat, the garlic, ginger, and salt, and fry until aromatic, about 10 minutes.\n9. Reserve ¼ of the fried garlic mixture, then add the rice to the remaining fried garlic and stir to coat. Cook for 3 minutes.\n10. Transfer the rice to a rice cooker and add 2 cups (480 ml) of reserved poaching broth. Steam the rice for 60 minutes, or until tender.\n11. While the rice is cooking, carve the chicken for serving.\n12. Make the chili sauce: combine the sambal, Sriracha, sugar, garlic, ginger, lime juice, and chicken broth in a small bowl and stir to incorporate.\n13. Make the ginger garlic sauce: in a small bowl, combine the ginger, garlic, salt, peanut oil, and rice vinegar, and stir to incorporate.\n14. Make the soy sauce: in a small bowl, combine the reserved fried garlic and ginger with the oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, and chicken broth, and stir to incorporate.\n15. Serve the sliced chicken with the rice, dipping sauces, sliced cucumbers, and fresh cilantro.\n16. Enjoy",

        "steps": "1. Cook the rice following pack instructions, then drain, spread it out to steam-dry and set aside.\n2. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a large wok over a high heat, then add the onion and fry until lightly browned, around 5 mins. Add the rice, stir and toast for about 3 mins, then move to the side of the pan.\n3. Add the remaining oil, then tip in the egg mixture. Leave to cook a little, then mix in with the rice – stir vigorously to coat the grains or, if you prefer the egg chunkier, allow to set for a little longer before breaking up and stirring through. Tip into a serving bowl and scatter over the spring onion to serve.",

        "category": "western",
        "ingredients": {
            "all-purpose flour": "7 tablespoons all-purpose flour",
            "corn starch": "7 tablespoons cornstarch",
            "sea salt": "1 teaspoon sea salt",
            "cod fillet": "4 pieces fish fillet",
            "potatoes": "2 pounds peeled potatoes",
            "vegetable oil": "1 litre vegetable oil (for frying)"
        },
        "steps": "1. Gather the ingredients.\n2. Set aside 2 tablespoons of flour. In a large, roomy bowl, mix the remaining flour with the cornstarch and baking powder. Season lightly with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper.\n3. Using a fork to whisk continuously, add the beer and the sparkling water to the flour mixture and continue mixing until you have a thick, smooth batter. Place the batter in the fridge to rest for between 30 minutes and 1 hour.\n4. Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into a little less than 1/2-inch-thick slices, then slice these into 1/2-inch-wide chips. Place the chips into a colander and rinse under cold running water.\n5. Place the washed chips into a pan of cold water. Bring to a gentle boil and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.\n6. Drain carefully through a colander, then dry with paper towels. Keep in the fridge covered with paper towels until needed.\n7. Meanwhile, lay the fish fillets on a paper towel and pat dry. Season lightly with a little sea salt.\n8. Heat the oil to 350 F in a deep-fat fryer or large, deep saucepan. Cook the chips a few handfuls at a time in the fat for about 2 minutes. Do not brown them. Once the chips are slightly cooked, remove them from the fat and drain. Keep to one side.\n9. Place the 2 tablespoons of flour reserved from the batter mix into a shallow bowl. Toss each fish fillet in the flour and shake off any excess.\n10. Dip into the batter, coating the entire fillet.\n11. Check that the oil temperature is still 350 F. Carefully lower each fillet into the hot oil. Fry for approximately 8 minutes, or until the batter is crisp and golden, turning the fillets from time to time with a large slotted spoon.\n12. Once cooked, remove the fillets from the hot oil and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt. Cover with greaseproof paper (parchment paper) and keep hot.\n13. Heat the oil to 400 F, then cook the chips until golden and crisp, or about 5 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain. Season with salt.\n14. Serve immediately with the hot fish accompanied by your favorite condiment.",

Season the steaks on both sides with salt and pepper.\n3. Place the steaks in a single layer in the pan. Cook for 4-5 minutes per side or until browned. Use a thermometer to cook the steak to your desired level of doneness. I recommend cooking to medium which is 145 degrees F.\n4. While the steak is cooking, place the butter in a bowl along with the garlic, herbs, salt and pepper. Stir to combine.\n5. Let the steaks rest for at least 5 minutes off the heat. Place a dollop of butter on top of each steak. Slice the steak. Garnish with additional fresh herbs if desired, then serve.",

        },
        "steps": "1. Heat pasta water: Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water.)\n2. Sauté pancetta/bacon and garlic: While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy.\n3. Add the garlic (if using) and cook another minute, then turn off the heat and put the pancetta and garlic into a large bowl.\n4. Beat eggs and half of the cheese: In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese.\n5. Cook pasta: Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil.\n6. Toss pasta with pancetta/bacon: When the pasta is al dente (still a little firm, not mushy), use tongs to move it to the bowl with the bacon and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water.\n7. Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the pasta to be hot. It's the heat of the pasta that will heat the eggs sufficiently to create a creamy sauce.\n8. Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn't make the eggs curdle when you mix them in. (That's the tricky part.)\n9. Add the beaten egg mixture: Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more. Add salt to taste. Add some pasta water back to the pasta to keep it from drying out.\n10. Serve at once with the rest of the parmesan and freshly ground black pepper.",

Cover the shaped dough lightly with plastic wrap and allow it to rest as the oven preheats.\n2. To prevent the pizza toppings from making your pizza crust soggy, brush the shaped dough lightly with olive oil. Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Top the dough evenly with pizza sauce, then add the cheese, ham, pineapple, and bacon.\n3. Bake pizza for 12-15 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with fresh basil, if desired. Slice hot pizza and serve immediately.\n4. Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be frozen up to 3 months. See pizza crust recipe for instructions on freezing the pizza dough.",

Combine all the marinade ingredients in a bowl and mix them well. Pour it over the meat. Cover and marinate it for at least 4 hours or overnight in the fridge to deepen the flavor. You can certainly marinate it for a lot shorter time, but the chicken will be less flavorful.\n3. Cook the chicken over a well heated skillet. (If grilling, cook the chicken following your grill manual.) Do not add the leftover marinade. (I use a slotted spoon to minimize the marinade transfer.)  Sizzle both sides of chicken over medium high heat then reduce the heat to medium until the chicken is fully cooked.\n4. In the mean time, boil over the leftover marinade in a separate sauce pan for 2-3 mins over medium high heat, stirring occasionally. Sieve through any excess fat and undesirable pieces from the sauce. Set the sauce aside.\n5. Serve. Glaze the sauce over the chicken.",
